# team27Project
plan and code for engr101 project 3
Engr 101 AVC Plan:
Team number : 27
Team members:
Thomas 
Nathika 
Logan
Oliver
As discussed prior on discord the workload will be spread as evenly as possible with changing roles. For example two people code for core and two people check the functionality and layout for core, these roles will then reverse when we move onto completion and challenge.
Key dates: 
The project is due on the 19th of June.(conflicts with this date may be comp , engr and cybr assignments).
The plan needs to be submitted before the 4th of June.
The timeline fore each phase is about 5 days until the due date.
Core (5 days) – due date 8th of June
Completion(5 days) – due date 13th of June
Challenge (5 days) – due date 18th of June
The timeline for Team logs will be caught up every second day of each phase where each member will submit a short sentence discussing milestones reached from the following days and any other key points to address to other members.
Roles per phase:
Core: Oliver and Nathika will work together to code the program, Thomas and Logan will check functionality and overall execution they, may also be able to give advice on the code itself.
Completion: Thomas and Logan work together to code the program, Oliver and Nathika will check functionality and overall execution, they may also be able to give advice on code itself.
Challenge: All four team members (if able) will do a rough draft on how they think the challenge can work. Then will test each other’s code for functionality and overall execution giving advice on code itself. From there the team will agree on a piece on code and add that to the final project code.
Primary source of communication will be discord, and to share team logs Google doc.
